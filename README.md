Build without boss bullet sound to see if lag is taken care of after removing audio source from each bullet. Some rooms that have multiple enemies with bullets to fire might still have that lag so need to see about the audio causing lag. Although all audio will be different including all sprites/tilesets etc. Main player -Ninja has 20 sec dash invincibility in order to be able to run through game to test. Also made that value for Xlink if you see/decide to unlock it. All others have original values.
